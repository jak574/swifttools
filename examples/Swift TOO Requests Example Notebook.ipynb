    "The `Swift_TOO_Requests` (or shorthand as of `swifttools` 2.3, `TOORequests`) allows the user to query submitted Swift TOO requests. This can be used either to retrieve detail on requests that you have submitted, or details on all TOO requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Detailed information on TOOs, including Science Justification text are only retrievable if you are the TOO submitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Only details of approved TOO requests are available. TOOs that have been rejected cannot be fetched.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is therefore useful if you wish to retrieve what you have previously submitted, or see what the current active TOOs are, so you can see if someone has already submitted a TOO for the target you are interested in."
