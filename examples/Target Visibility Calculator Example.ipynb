    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how we can use the `swift_too` module to give us predicted long term visibility for targets. Note that long term visibility calculates if a target can be observed on Swift based on Sun, Moon and Pole constraints. It does not calculate the visibility due to Earth occultations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visibility is based on the most up to date TLE derived prediction of the spacecraft location into the future. Although this will not affect Sun and Moon constraints, Pole constraint accuracy may get worse the further into the future we look.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the Query\n",
    "\n",
    "First step, import the `Swift_VisQuery` class from TOO API, and whatever supporting Python modules we might need along the way. *Note*: As of `swifttools` 2.3, we can use shorthand for class names, by omitting the `Swift_`, so in this case, just `VisQuery` will do."
