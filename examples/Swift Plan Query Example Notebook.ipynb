    "The Swift_PlanQuery class allows for querying the database of observations have have been planned for observation by Swift, otherwise known as the \"Pre-Planned Science Timeline\" (PPST). This allows the user to find out not only what was planned, but what will be observed by Swift in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For past observations, what should have been down is mostly an academic exercise, as due to TOO uploads and GRBs, Swift's pre-planned observations can be obliterated. If you want to know what Swift *did* observe, do a Swift_ObsQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Swift's planning is only done days into the future, so if you want to know what is going to happen weeks from now, you're out of luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "This therefore is mostly useful if you want to know what Swift is observing *today* and *tomorrow*."
