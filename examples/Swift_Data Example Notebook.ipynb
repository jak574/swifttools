    "We've demonstrated that with classes such as Swift_ObsQuery we can find out what Swift has observed, but what if we want to download the data associated with an observation? Before you had to go to a web interface to download the data you wanted. More confusingly, the data usually reside in one of two places: the archive or the quicklook area. Typically recent observations exist in quicklook, and older observations are in the archive. \n",

Let's find a recent observation, and download it. How about the first few observations of Jan 10th, 2021? As of `swifttools` 2.3, you can shorten the names of the classes by removing the `Swift_` so we'll use just `Data` and for the next example, `ObsQuery`."
