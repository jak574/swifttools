    "What is GUANO? It is the Gamma-ray Urgent Archive for Novel Opportunities. GUANO is fully explained in the paper by [Tohuvavohu et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900...35T/abstract). Essentially it is this, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is a coded mask telesope, which records individual X-ray photons as events. These events are then processed onboard to look for GRB triggers. However, sometimes the onboard trigger algorithm fails to find a GRB that is present in the BAT field of view. In these cases, it would be best to look at the event data on the ground to do a more detailed analysis to look for GRB events, however, because of telemetery limitations, the event data is only held onboard for around 25-30 mins before it is deleted. \n",
    "\n",
    "The GUANO program seeks to solve this problem, but proactively commanding Swift to keep and downlink BAT event data for times of interest. Right now this includes times at which other instruments trigger, such as Fermi/GBM, INTEGRAL, CALET and other GRB missions, as well as multi-messenger observatories such as IceCube and LIGO/Virgo/Kagra. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Swift_GUANO` API allows you to query when these dumps occurred and were successful, and where to look for the BAT event data that were dump. We're going to use the shorthand for this class, simply `GUANO`.\n"

    "Basic information given here is the source of the trigger, usually a GRB detector, but also FRB and GW detectors. The trigger time is given, along with an offset and window duration. The offset is how much the window start is biased towards the trigger time. So for offset zero, and window duration of 200s, the trigger will be in the center of the window, at 100s. For offset 50, the window is moved 50 later, so the trigger will be at 50s and the window ends at T+150s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note if the Window Duration has a number in brackets after it, this means that the actual length of the dump is different from that requested. This can happen due to either the dump skimming the South Atlantic Anomaly (where no data is collected), or sometimes if the dump is commanded too late, and some of the data have been lost. Alternatively this can be due to the fact that the data has not been fully processed yet, so if the dump is recent, this may resolve itself in a few hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases where the number is larger than the requested duration, this can mean that other nearby trigger was merged to create a larger dump, or in extreme cases, that the dump time overlaps a BAT detected GRB. The latter case is rare as we try to filter these out on the ground.\n",

In addition to what we see in the summary table, there are a few more parameters. `quadsaway` is perhaps the most complicated to understand, but perhaps also not necessary. Essentially the BAT event data live in a ring buffer, this ring buffer overwrites itself, with events living around ~25 mins in the buffer before they are overwritten. `quadsaway` gives the number of quadbytes between the dump and the buffer pointer at the time of dump. If this value is positive, it means that no data was overwritten.

    "Also you'll note `utcf`, which is a negative number of seconds. This is the Univeral Time Correction Factor (UTCF), which corrects time that Swift reports to actual UT. This includes both correction for drift in the Swift clock, and leap seconds. GUANO trigger times and `begin` and `end` times are corrected using this `utcf` value, as it is important that the reported times match a common time system when comparing with other missions. \n",

    "Other times, such as those reported by Swift_ObsQuery for when Swift observations occur, are not at this time corrected to UTC, as the absolute timing for these is are not critical. UTCF corrections are typically performed during data analysis, for example when performing barycentric correction using the standard HEAsoft `barycorr` tool.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As noted elsewhere, clock correction can now be performed on results from a class using the `clock_correct` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of `swifttools` 2.4, all recorded dates in the `GUANO` class and its subclasses are automatically clock corrected. By default, all dates are UTC, not Swift time, and dates are stored in the `swiftdatetime` format, which is an extended version of Python's `datetime`, which supports clock correction, and MET conversion.
